                        I am Yida Zou, a 20-year-old Computer Science Major at Texas A&M. I'm very passionate about art as you can tell by my Behance Art Portfolio. Developing AI that creates art like DALL-E is something I'm interested in. Despite how some may view AI as the death of artists, I actually have a pretty optimistic view of how AI will affect artists. Of course, the immediate effect could be that simple commission artists could lose their customers, but I think it would have an overall positive impact in the long run. AI's like DALL-E will help reward pure creativity that isn't limited to only hand skills. It would reward people who could be referred to as 'wordsmiths' who know exactly the words to describe to the AI to get the results they want. In the same way, traditional art didn't die when digital art become a thing and tools like Photoshop became available, AI will simply be another tool for artists.

                        In fact, I've used it myself to modify some of my own past paintings.
                        Here is my <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/74986259/Pill-too-hard-to-swallow/modules/435964119">original painting</a> and this is the <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/pUfSyBh15uMTKmjugvJgP8xu">modified version</a> I made using DALL-E.
                        Another <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/95557313/Walking/modules/551962273">example</a> and <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/Sh24P5gMzCw5pZft5H2Dph3q">some</a> of the <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/utHLOmvLhxFdXuEUW7RLN613">variations</a>.
                        The original paintings were made using colored pencils, acrylic, and watercolor.
                        I used a technique referred to as outcropping to modify my pieces. As you can probably tell by the meaning of the word, I used DALL-E to expand the borders of the original art piece.

                        Some more background about myself is that I was born in Bejing, China, but I left when I was three and moved to Canada with my family. We lived there for a year before settling in Houston, Texas where I grew up and have lived ever since. I graduated from Bellaire High School and am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Texas A&M.
